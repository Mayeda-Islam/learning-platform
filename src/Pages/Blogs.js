        <p>
          CORS is a way to whitelist requests to your web server from certain
          locations, by specifying response headers like
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'. It's an important protocol for making
          cross-domain requests possible, in cases where there's a legitimate
          need to do so
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
